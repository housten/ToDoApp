# Setting up Branch Protection Rules

First we need to create our own repo from this template, clone it locally and open it in Copilot.
Make sure that copilot is installed and up and running. 

## Case : We will start adding more people to this project. How to make sure changes are good?

```promt
Im starting to enroll more contributors on this project, so I need to be careful to review the changes. How can I enforce this on this repository?
```

We will follow the instructions of Copilot and go create branch protection rules

## Case : We see there are many settings to be set, what should we configure?

```promt
I see that there are many rules I can set, which ones should i configure?
```

Ask for description of some of the other settings
```promt
I see that there are many rules I can set, which ones should i configure?
```

## Case : We want people to be competent on what they approve

```promt
on the request pr before merging, how do I know that the reviewer is someone who is competent?
```

Specify
```promt
I have some people in the team that are certified css experts. I want only them to be able to approve changes to css files
```

Getting to teams
```promt
the team of css experts might change with time, is there a way i can reference them without specifying the user names
```
